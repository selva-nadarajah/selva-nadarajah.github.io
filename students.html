                            I enjoy working with graduate students. PhD students that I collaborate with me are
                            strong in algorithms and programming or have a strong mathematical background, ideally
                            both. They are passionate about solving
                            challenging business problems using reinforcement learning, optimization, and high
                            dimensional statistics. Masters
                            students that I
                            work with are computationally strong and self-motivated
                            to learn new technical material and methods. Please see below for past students, their
                            profiles, and nature of work. Before emailing me, I recommend that you do the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Browse through my research publications and working papers to identify any past projects or ongoing work that is of interest to you. Read such papers more carefully and include specifics
                                    of what you find interesting in your email. <br><br></li>
                                <li> I welcome new ideas outside my ongoing or past work. If you are contacting me with
                                    a new idea for collaboration, kindly indicate why my involvement would be useful (it may not be!).<br><br>

                                <li> If applicable, please consult with your PhD advisor and make sure they are onboard.<br><br>
