							<span style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"> About me: </span> Before joining
							UIC, I did my PhD and MS in Operations
							Research at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon
							University. My journey to North America started at the
							University of Waterloo, where I obtained an MASc in Operations Research and learnt the
							importance of asking "<a href="https://selvan.people.uic.edu/UWWhyNot.jpg">Why
								Not?</a>".<br><br>

							I was born in <a
								href="https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredible-india-v2/en.html">incredible
								India</a> and grew up in the beautiful island of <a
								href="https://www.srilanka.travel/">Sri Lanka</a> (a.k.a. the pearl of the Indian ocean)
							before heading back to Chennai for my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institue of
							Technology Madras. I have enjoyed consulting with companies in the retail,
							high technology, and energy industries along the way.
